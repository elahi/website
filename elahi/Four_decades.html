          <p>It is well known that   humans are modifying the environment in many ways, including climate   change, non-native species introductions, and habitat protection.  Many   marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and kelp forests, have   undergone dramatic transitions from structurally complex and   biologically rich communities to structurally simple and depauperate   habitats often dominated by weedy algae.  Field studies that span   several decades are rare, but important when trying to evaluate the role   of human activities on the environment.  In this study we asked: how   and why have subtidal rock wall communities in the San Juan Islands   changed over four decades?   <br>

            <p>An   archive of underwater photographs taken by former University of   Washington graduate student Charles Birkeland between 1969 and 1974 was   compared with my own photographs at the same study site between 2008 and   2011.  Surprisingly, the historical communities exhibited lower   biodiversity (fewer species) than the modern communities.  This result   is likely related to intense grazing by animals like chitons (snail   relatives), rather than species introductions in modern times.  Modern   and historic communities exhibited similar stability, and thus the data   suggest that there has been limited change over four decades, despite a   clear increase in temperature (due to climate change) and fish abundance   (due to the establishment of marine protected areas).  The lack of   change in these rock wall communities may be related to their vertical   topography, which limits physical disturbance and prevents weedy algae   from taking over space.  <br>
