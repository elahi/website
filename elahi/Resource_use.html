          <p>Resource competition theory predicts an inverse   relationship between species richness and resource availability.  More   species should more fully exploit available resources, decreasing the   rate of colonization by both native and exotic species.  Space is the   limiting resource for sessile organisms on marine rocky substrata, and   the availability of space is limited by recruitment and growth and   increased through senescence, disturbance and consumption.  Surveys and a   three-month urchin addition experiment were used to test whether   consumers mediate variation between prey richness and resource (space)   use in subtidal rock wall communities.  In summary, urchins generate   available space directly by consuming large invertebrates and   macroalgae, and indirectly by facilitating chitons, which maintain   patches of space by consuming microscopic recruits of adult sessile   organisms.  Interestingly, prey richness may buffer the impacts of   urchin grazing – and thus we highlight the need to study the effects of   species richness on community structure and function in the context of   other relevant ecological processes.  </p>

            A second experiment   tested the extent to which urchins and chitons are redundant in the   maintenance of available space.  We reduced the densities of urchins and   chitons on subtidal rock walls for nine months.  The effects of grazers   were interpreted in the context of natural temporal variation by   monitoring the benthic community one year before, during, and after   grazer removal.  The removal of each grazer in isolation had no effect   on the epilithic community, but the removal of both grazers caused an   increase in sessile invertebrates.  The increase was due primarily to   clonal ascidians, which displayed a large (~75%) relative increase in   response to the removal of both grazers.  However, the observed   non-additive responses to grazer removal were temporary and smaller than   seasonal fluctuations.  The data demonstrate that urchins and chitons   can be redundant in the maintenance of available space, and highlight   the value of drawing conclusions from experimental manipulations within   an extended temporal context. <br>
