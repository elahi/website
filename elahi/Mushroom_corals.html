<p>Mushroom corals (Fungia spp.) are an enigmatic group of tropical reef corals.  Unlike most corals, Fungia   species are not colonial, but solitary organisms.  A juvenile coral   looks like a mushroom (hence the common name) and grows in the protected   crevices of the reef framework.  At some point, the coral detaches from   its stalk, and actually moves (by contracting and expanding its tissue) out onto the reef for further growth and eventual reproduction.  Often, Fungia will move away from the natal reef, thereby expanding the size of reefs laterally.   <br>
</p>
<p>In Moorea, French   Polynesia, I tested whether photosynthetic energy intake limits the   maximum size of these corals by applying a model developed originally   for anemones (Anthopleura xanthogrammica).  Unlike the anemones, growth in Fungia concinna   is not limited strictly be energetic constraints, and maximum size must   instead be determined by alternative physiological or ecological   constraints.  </p>

<p>Often, mushroom corals occur in heterospecific aggregations, but visible   signs of direct competition are uncommon.  Although negative   interactions between fungiids are generally though to be negligible, I   used a simple field experiment in Okinawa, Japan to show that   calcification is reduced in groups.  The reduction in growth did not   depend on the identity of the neighbor (the same species or a different   species).  Surprisingly, neighbor identity did affect coral behavior -   mucus production and movement occurred more frequently in heterospecific   than conspecific groups.  These results suggest that there is a cost to   group living, but there may be (unmeasured) benefits to living in   conspecific aggregations.  </p>
