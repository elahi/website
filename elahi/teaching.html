      Teaching is a natural complement to the doing of science.  To date, I have taught in a variety of capacities - as a teaching assistant, lecturer, and high school teacher.  In general, I try to engage students with a problem or activity in order to develop a conceptual understanding of the core question or issue.  This strategy was especially important when I was a GK-12 teaching fellow at Friday Harbor High School and Garfield High School. <br>
    </p>
      <p>For example, when I taught my Marine Science students at Garfield High School about evolutionary relationships (phylogeny), I had a few students draw a simple fish.  These basal fish were then passed on to other students, who traced the original fish but modified one trait (e.g., fin shape, coloration).  The students then assembled branching trees based on the similarities and differences among fish.</p>

      <p>Another particularly successful lesson I developed at Friday Harbor High School focused on embryology – specifically, in urchins.  In addition to live demos of urchin sperm, eggs, and fertilization, the students used clay to model the critical stages of embryonic and larval development.  Surprisingly, the clay activity was more instructive than the live demo, and I believe that was because the students were in control of the activity.</p>

      <p>As an undergraduate lecturer at California State University, Monterey Bay, I continued to embrace the inquiry-driven, hands-on approach.  Admittedly, it is more cumbersome as class size increases – and lecture slides are a necessary evil at the college level.  However, techniques like the inverted classroom (where students do ‘homework’ in class, and read lecture material at home), helped alleviate the monotony of hour-long lectures.  But the single most important aspect of any biology class is face time with the organisms, preferably in their natural habitat.  For this reason, my favorite learning and teaching situations have always been in the laboratory and field, where the creatures provide inspiration and promote creativity. </p>
