      Like science, teaching is an iterative process that includes constant reflection, acceptance of errors, and discovery. To date, I have taught in a variety of capacities - as a teaching assistant, lecturer, and high school teacher. Over the past decade, I have developed the core of my undergraduate teaching philosophy.  Rather than recite a list of facts (e.g., types of species interactions), I aim to reveal the general underlying principles using a conceptual framework (e.g., simple population models).  I am also dedicated to teaching skills (e.g., programming, statistics) that are relevant across disciplines.  In short, I aim to equip students with the intuition and tools to measure nature.<br>
